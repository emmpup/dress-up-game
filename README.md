1. A **dress-up system** that allows players to:

    - Customize their character with different outfits, shoes, and accessories
    - Change hairstyles and eye styles
    - Save their character design

2. A **platformer game** where:
    - Players can control a cat using the arrow keys, W, A, D, and space bar
    - Navigate through a scene with platforms
    - Access the dress-up system through an overlay interface
    - See their saved character design in the game environment

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a pixelated art style and responsive design.
